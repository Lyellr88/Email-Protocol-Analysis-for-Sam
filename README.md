Hey Sam,

I'm glad you liked the README document. I treated it as my blueprint while dissecting your protocol, so it's good to know that approach is valuable for future clients as well.

I reviewed your notes carefully and ran targeted validations based on the exact points you raised. This led me to test the current prompt, with no modifications, across different models to pinpoint the source of the inconsistencies.

These are the results - Gemini passed on approximately 83% of the protocol's steps, while Grok's performance was around 32%.

Where Gemini failed at is one of your issues you pointed out, that isn't LLM based. The correct count of URL links was not displayed; it should have been 13 (I added more links to your sample email for testing). This issue will be addressed.

<h3>HTML Structural Issues</h3>
<p>The email's code has technical issues that can impair deliverability and rendering across different email clients.</p>
<p class="relevant">The HTML is malformed, with several links appearing after the closing </html> tag. The layout also uses a table and div nesting depth greater than 6 layers, which adds unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h3>Missing Plain-Text Version</h3>
<p>A plain-text version of the email was not detected. The absence of a plain-text alternative is a negative signal for spam filters, which expect it for accessibility and compatibility.</p>

As the data shows, Grok failed to identify the critical "make money" trigger phrase, missed the malformed HTML and deep table nesting, and incorrectly flagged an issue with font stacks that was not in violation of the protocol. This level of inconsistency and omission is a significant risk for a project that requires precision.

With that being said, my professional recommendation is to use Gemini, Claude, or a more recent version of GPT for this task. I want to see your company succeed, and a project with this level of detail requires an AI model that can reliably execute these complex instructions.

I am still happy to make the requested revisions tailored for Grok, but I felt it was my professional responsibility to provide this data and my opinion before we finalize the work.
Of course, the non-LLM based issue you brought up (grouping similar findings under a single heading) is a straightforward formatting update that I will address in the final version of the prompt regardless.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
